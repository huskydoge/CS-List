## Biography

Hi! I am an assistant professor of computer science and statistics at Stanford. My research interests broadly include topics in machine learning, algorithms and their theory, such as deep learning, (deep) reinforcement learning, pre-training / foundation models, robustness, non-convex optimization, distributed optimization, and high-dimensional statistics.





## Selected PhDs





## Selected Masters







## Recruitment Information

### Undergraduate Internship

If you are a student at Stanford, please feel free to directly email me. If you are interested in machine learning theory research, typically I would recommend you to take my course CS229M/STATS214 first because it covers many basics for ML theory research. 
My group does have a very small number of undergraduate summer intern positions for students outside Stanford every year. Unfortunately, we are not able to provide financial support, and we are only able to host people who have financial support from their home institutions.
If you are interested in working with us in the summer, please email me with

* your CV
* your transcripts 
* some highlights of your past works/achievements in the email texts


Due to a large number of requests, I, unfortunately, may not be able to reply to all the emails regarding the summer intern position inquiries.
