## Biography

**My primary research interests lie in the general areas of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, as well as ML systems, computer vision, healthcare, and other application domains.**

In particular, I'm interested in principles and methodologies of Panoramic Learning ([HDSR](https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.1d34757b))â€”building AI agents with ALL types of experience, ranging from data instances ([NeurIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12795)), embodied experiences ([NeurIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10626)), structured knowledge ([ACL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06318), [NeurIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09764)), constraints, to rewards ([EMNLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12548)), adversaries ([NeurIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06900)), lifelong interplay, etc. To this end, we've been studying a standardized ML formalism ("Standard Model" of ML) for systematic understanding, unifying, and generalizing a wide range of ML paradigms (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, active, reinforcement, adversarial, meta, lifelong learning). We're also building World Models ([EMNLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14992), [NeurIPS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10626)) to enable next-generation machine reasoning beyond large language models.

On this basis, I develop methods and tools for Composable ML that enable easy composition of ML solutions ([LLM Reasoners](https://github.com/Ber666/llm-reasoners), and [Texar, ASYML](https://github.com/asyml) as part of the open-source consortium [CASL](http://casl-project.ai/)); and rich applications for controllable text generation ([ICML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00955)) and others.

## Recruitment Information

I am taking on **new students and postdocs** from HDSI, CSE, and related departments. We also have research positions for MS/undergrad students (UCSD or external). See more details [here](http://zhiting.ucsd.edu/prospective.html).

**Visiting scholars / interns**:
We usually have openings for visiting scholars (graduate/undergrad students, etc) with external funding. Visitors are expected to stay for **at least 3 months and preferably 6-12 months**. Please make sure you indicate the time range in your email.
