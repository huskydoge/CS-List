## Biography

My research focuses on machine learning and natural language processing. In particular, I am interested in basic research and applications of large language models, with a particular focus on question answering, code generation, multilingual processing, and evaluation/interpretability. You can find more details, [research page](https://www.phontron.com/research.php) or [publications page](https://www.phontron.com/publications.php), and reference my [third-person bio](https://www.phontron.com/bio.php) for talk introductions, etc..

I like developing, and have created open-source software which I have summarized here: [software page](https://www.phontron.com/software.php). I also post class and tutorial notes [teaching page](https://www.phontron.com/teaching.php) in the hope that people will find them useful. I also talk about research on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gneubig) occasionally.

## Recruitment Information

I get a lot of email requesting visits from really great and interesting researchers, and I really appreciate your interest. Unfortunately, however, due to my personal time constraints and also the limited number of seats I can allocate for visitors in my lab, it is very rare that I can take external visitors. I get a lot of email requesting short-term or long-term internships (particularly over the summer), so as much as I would like to, I can't respond to all of them personally.
