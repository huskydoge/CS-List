## Biography

I am an assistant professor of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) and I co-lead the [Princeton NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.princeton.edu/). Previously, I was a visiting scientist at [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://ai.facebook.com/) in Seattle. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2018, where I was advised by [Christopher Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/) and worked in the [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student from the [Special Pilot CS Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) supervised by [Andrew Yao](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yao/) at Tsinghua University.

## Recruitment Information

**Prospective students**: I am actively looking for strong and motivated students to join our group! If you are interested in working with me, please apply through the [Princeton CS PhD program](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad) and mention me in your application (and I can't respond to individual emails).

**Princeton students**: (1) If you are already a **graduate student** at Princeton, feel free to reach out. (2) **Undergraduate students**: Considering my bandwidth and current group size, I won't be able to take on more undergraduate advisees for senior thesis and independent work in AY23-24 unfortunately. You are always welcome to reach out directly to my [graduate students](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/lab.html) and work with them (a good starting point is to check out our [recent publications](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/papers.html) and interests on their websites, and send them an email/schedule a chat!). We also strongly encourage you take COS324/COS484 first, and also fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/8sp37dy4j6k1nCZq5) before you reach out.
