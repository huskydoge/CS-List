## Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Toronto and a Research Scientist (part-time) at the Toyota Research Institute (TRI). Prior to that, I was a Research Scientist at MIT where I was part of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab working with Sertac Karaman and Daniela Rus.

I joined MIT from the Autonomous Systems Lab of ETH Zurich where I worked with Roland Siegwart on robotic perception, particularly localization and mapping. I obtained my PhD degree in computer science working on nonlinear estimation at the Intelligent Sensor-Actuator-Systems Lab of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. It was supervised by Uwe Hanebeck and Simon Julier (co-supervisor).

The goal of our research is to enable robust interactive autonomy in robotics. Our current work focuses on understanding the foundations of robot learning by using real-world data for creating more realistic simulation environments. We are also interested in novel perception and sensing modalities. Overall, our research spans basic problems in machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. Current interests involve the following topics:

- Robotics: Robotic Perception and Robot Learning with applications in Autonomous Navigation and Manipulation.
- Computer Vision: Efficient & Editable Neural 3D Reconstruction, Neuromorphic Vision, Pose & Motion Estimation.
- Machine Learning: Geometric Deep Learning, Causal Representation Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Imitation Learning.

## Recruitment Information

Visitors are welcome at all levels. Priority is given to self-funded visitors but we try to be helpful in obtaining funding. For undergraduates, funding can be obtained e.g. via the Mitacs Globalink Program (only for certain countries).

We also accept remote interns from time to time but these spots are very limited and highly dependent on our current bandwidth and research needs. If you are interested in becoming a remote intern, please send an email with CV and grade transcripts to: [tisl-apply@cs.toronto.edu](tisl-apply@cs.toronto.edu).
