## Biography

I am currently a visiting researcher at Meta/Facebook AI Research ([FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/research/)). Previously, I was a postdoc researcher at Stanford working with Dr. [Chris RÃ©](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University under the supervision of Dr. [Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/) in 2020. I received my B.S. from University of California, Berkeley in 2015. My mentors were Dr. [Sara Alspaugh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salspaugh/), Dr. [Kaifei Chen](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kaifei/) and my advisor was Dr. [Randy Katz](http://bnrg.eecs.berkeley.edu/~randy/). My research focuses on large-scale machine learning. Specifically, I design and optimize randomized algorithms (algorithm-hardware co-design) to accelerate large machine learning systems for real-world problems.
